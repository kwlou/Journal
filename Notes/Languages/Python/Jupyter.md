# Jupyter 
## Notebook
...Reference Lab for essentially the same behavior

This one is very simple but I know I got the below one to work too...

Lab
Run jupyter remotely from container
Source: benjlindsay

To run Jupyter Lab on a login node, you need to open 2 terminal windows. In the first window:

Note to self, when doing this for containers, run this remembering we are mapping the container port 5678 to server port 5678 with -p 5678:5678. Example command:

docker run -it --ipc=host --name=ben_pytorch_tutorial -p 5678:5678 --runtime=nvidia -v /home/bb927/Documents/pytorch:/workspace pytorch/pytorch:latest bash
Note, additional step to install jupyter could be required $ pip install jupyterlab. (You'll need a container with python in it)

Then inside the container start jupyter:

$ jupyter lab --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 5678 --no-browser --allow-root

and see it running...

[I 22:05:13.843 LabApp] Writing notebook server cookie secret to /root/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/notebook_cookie_secret
[I 22:05:14.047 LabApp] JupyterLab extension loaded from /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages/jupyterlab
[I 22:05:14.047 LabApp] JupyterLab application directory is /opt/conda/share/jupyter/lab
[I 22:05:14.050 LabApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /workspace
[I 22:05:14.050 LabApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at:
[I 22:05:14.050 LabApp] http://353e1fa49ecd:5678/?token=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
[I 22:05:14.050 LabApp]  or http://127.0.0.1:5678/?token=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
[I 22:05:14.050 LabApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
[C 22:05:14.053 LabApp] 

    To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
        file:///root/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-45-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://353e1fa49ecd:5678/?token=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
     or http://127.0.0.1:5678/?token=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Then in the second terminal window run:

$ ssh -CNL localhost:5678:localhost:5678 username@hostname
Finally copy the link from the jupyter lab step into your browser (http://127.0.0.1:5678/?token=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX).

Run jupyter remotely from server
Log into server and start jupyter:

$ ssh username@hostname
$ jupyter lab --no-browser --port=5678
...
[I 10:17:14.160 LabApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
[C 10:17:14.160 LabApp]

    Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time,
    to login with a token:
        http://localhost:5678/?token=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Then in the second window (local machine) run:

$ ssh -CNL localhost:5678:localhost:5678 username@hostname
You should be able to go to http://localhost:5678 to see jupyter lab now.
